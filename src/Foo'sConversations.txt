Mini carrots taste delicious!
I want to eat Raspberry Pi!
I need to play Burb Game!
I'm 1/9th of a Burb!
My nose is crooked!
Nobody knows where the nose goes but Jim Brown knows!
Who knows where the goes?
The common ancestor of me and Nominee is potato!
The Power of Foo is almighty!
Derivatives are better than integrals!

Louep louep!
